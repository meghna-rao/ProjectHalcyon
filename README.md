This web - application works on a software MAMP.Once the MAMP software is installed all the PHP files can be added to the ht-docs file.Subsequently
the SQL files can be added by opening up mamp and importing the files through PHLmyadmin tools. The application then can be run locally by first signing up and then logging in for the
Web application to run.
